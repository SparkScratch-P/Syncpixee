The Guide to the New Suit:
---

The new suit contains a pre-made stage with the brand and project watermark.

It looks like the following picture:

The Top right hand tools pannel has 5 buttons : 

- **Add Sprite**: When you click on this button, your local file explorer opens up, and you can upload a pre-programmed sprite, coded in any mod; just needs to be in `.sprte3` extension.
- **Download Project**: This button instantly downloads the project from the scratch mod in .sb3 extension with current data values of variables and lists, along with all sprites.
- **Start**: This acts as the `Green Flag` on scratch.
- **Stop**: This acts as the `Stop` on scratch.
- **Full Screen** : Toggles the fullscreen mode of the project.

Tips to use :

- **Uploading sprites :** You can upload sprites through the `Add Sprite` button. The sprite needs to be coded somewhere else, and should be in `.sprite3` extension. You can try different sprite mushups in this project in stead of just coding a single project.
- **Variables & Lists :** All lists and variables should be coded with show/hide controls to display or hide. By default, all lists/vars are hidden.
- **Cloud variables :** Scratch doesn't let other websites use its cloud server, but you can host your own using programs like primitive-cloud-server. You can connect to a primitive cloud server meant for scratch. The Guide is [available here](https://github.com/SheepTester/primitive-cloud-server). Some Cloud variables are given [special behaviours depending on their name](https://github.com/SheepTester/htmlifier/wiki/Special-cloud-behaviours).
- **Backdrop :** The default backdrop with the watermark cannot be changed. You can add a sprite with the `go back (1000) layers`block to set it as the backdrop.
- **Extensions :** This project support all officials extensions from scratch.
